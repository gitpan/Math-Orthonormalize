Math::Orthonormalize version 1.00
=================================

Math::Orthonormalize offers subroutines to compute normalized or
non-normalized orthogonal bases of Euclidean vector spaces. That means:
Given a vector base of R^n, it computes a new base of R^n whose individual
vectors are all orthogonal. If those new base vectors all have a length of
1, the base is orthonormalized.

The module uses the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

On platforms that don't support the "./" notation, that would be:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

If you wish, you may use the old MakeMaker style instead:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
